    "#### Validity\n",
    "4. `archive`: Retweets may capture the same dog twice with a different tweet_id\n",

    "#### Accuracy\n",

    "The previous gathering efforts took note of this pattern and was able to capture most of the dog's name by extracting the word after \"This is ...\".\n",

    "However, if the tweet did not begin with \"This is ...\" the name was defaulted to \"None\".  This explains the 745 records where the dog's name is \"None\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This method may also explains why the second most dog name is \"a\".  For example, if the tweet began with \"This is a good boy...\" then the method assigned the letter \"a\" to the dog's name.\n",

    "The cleaning effort tried to correct the dog's name by filtering by incorrectly labeled tweets, and finding their name in the body of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook only includes correction for dog names labeled as \"a\" because of time constraint. However, with more time and cleaning effort more dog names could be found."
